">Frequency Game</h1>

In this project, I have developed the Frequency Game, an engaging ReactJS application designed to challenge users' memory skills through emoji-based interactions. The game offers an interactive experience where players test their ability to recall previously clicked emojis, avoiding any repetitions.

The key components and functionalities of this project include:

- **Emoji Grid**: The main gameplay revolves around a grid of randomly displayed emojis. Users must click on each unique emoji only once. This dynamic display is powered by React components for smooth rendering and interaction.
- **Game Logic**: If a user clicks on an emoji they've already selected, the game is lost. The app provides immediate feedback through the "Lose Game" view and offers the option to play again, while keeping track of the highest score.
- **Winning Condition**: When users successfully click all unique emojis without repetition, they are greeted with a "Won Game" view. This victory screen acknowledges the player's achievement and resets the game state for a new round.
- **Score Management**: The app tracks both the current and top scores, motivating players to keep improving. The scores are updated in real-time, offering players constant feedback on their performance.
- **Replay Option**: After finishing a game, whether won or lost, users can choose to play again without losing their top score. This feature provides a seamless way to restart the challenge.

**Technologies used**: React JS, CSS, State Management, Conditional Rendering

In summary, the Frequency Game ReactJS application offers an enjoyable and mentally stimulating platform for users to test and improve their memory skills. It leverages React's powerful components and state management capabilities to provide a dynamic, responsive, and entertaining user experience.
