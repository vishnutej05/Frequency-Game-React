">Flex Reflex - Frequency Game</h1>

In this project, I have developed **Flex Reflex**, an interactive web-based game designed to test users' reflexes and attention to frequencies. Built with React, this game challenges users to click on specific frequencies within a limited time, improving their reaction speed and accuracy.

The key components and functionalities of this project include:

- **Frequency Display**: The core gameplay involves a dynamic display of frequencies. Users are prompted to click on the correct frequency as quickly as possible. The frequency values and timing are generated using React components that ensure smooth updates and rendering.
- **Timer and Score Tracking**: A countdown timer challenges users to respond within the time limit, and the scoring system keeps track of their accuracy. Players can monitor their score throughout the game, with a final tally displayed at the end.
- **Game Modes**: Flex Reflex offers multiple difficulty levels, allowing users to challenge themselves at various speeds and frequencies. These modes are selectable through an intuitive UI, making the game accessible to both beginners and experienced players.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal experience across devices, whether on desktop or mobile. The design is minimalistic yet engaging, providing a smooth, distraction-free interface.
- **Play Again Option**: After completing a round, users can quickly restart the game to improve their score or try a different difficulty level. The game loop ensures continuous engagement.

**Technologies used**: React JS, CSS, State Management, Responsive Design

In summary, **Flex Reflex** is a fast-paced, interactive game that sharpens users' reflexes and frequency recognition skills. It combines an elegant, minimalist design with powerful React functionality to create a smooth and engaging gaming experience for users of all skill levels.
